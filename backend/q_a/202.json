      "practice_question": "What facilitates associating multiple meanings with function name?",
      "answer": "Polymorphism and virtual functions associate meanings to function names."
    },
    {
      "practice_question": "What are the two types of overriding functions?",
      "answer": "Virtual functions override; overloading has different signatures."
    },
    {
      "practice_question": "What is the key difference between virtual and pure virtual functions?",
      "answer": "Pure virtual functions have no implementation in parent classes."

      "practice_question": "What is the function of abstract classes?",
      "answer": "Abstract classes serve as base classes without object creation."

      "practice_question": "What data structure is used for virtual functions?",
      "answer": "Virtual function tables (vtables) are used."

      "answer": "A virtual table pointer (*__vptr) enables calls."
