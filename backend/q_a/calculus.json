    {
      "practice_question": "What is the fundamental concept that the idea of a limit describes?",
      "answer": "A limit describes the value a function approaches as the input approaches some number; essentially what value is 'targeted'."
    },
    {
      "practice_question": "What condition must be met for a two-sided limit to exist?",
      "answer": "For a two-sided limit to exist, the one-sided limit from the left and the one-sided limit from the right must both exist and be equal."
    },
    {
      "practice_question": "What are the three conditions that a function must satisfy to be continuous at a point?",
      "answer": "A function must be defined at the point, the limit must exist at that point, and the function's value must equal the limit at that point."
    },
    {
      "practice_question": "Provide the formal limit definition of the derivative f'(x).",
      "answer": "The derivative is defined as f'(x) = lim (h->0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h; it is the limit of the difference quotient."
    },
    {
      "practice_question": "How can the derivative of a function at a point be geometrically interpreted?",
      "answer": "The derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at that point, representing the instantaneous rate of change."
