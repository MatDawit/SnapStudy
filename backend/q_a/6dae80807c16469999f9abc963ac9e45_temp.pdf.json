    {
      "practice_question": "What does polymorphism use for late binding?",
      "answer": "Polymorphism uses virtual functions for late binding."
    },
    {
      "practice_question": "What makes a parent class abstract?",
      "answer": "Pure virtual functions make a parent class abstract."
    },
    {
      "practice_question": "What happens without a virtual `Drive` function?",
      "answer": "The Vehicle's drive function is always called, not the Car's."
    },
    {
      "practice_question": "What is the purpose of virtual function tables?",
      "answer": "Virtual function tables (vtables) are used for polymorphism."
    },
    {
      "practice_question": "What do vtables contain?",
      "answer": "Vtables contain pointers to the virtual functions."
    },
    {
      "practice_question": "Why should classes declare a virtual destructor?",
      "answer": "To ensure derived class destructors are called, preventing memory leaks."
    },
    {
      "practice_question": "Are virtual constructors possible? Why or why not?",
      "answer": "No, virtual constructors are not possible because object construction requires complete type information."
